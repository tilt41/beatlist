Creates a xml file for [hydrogen](http://www.hydrogen-music.org/hcms/) to add sounds faster

Adding a folder of sounds to hydrogen requires a drumkit.xml file with all your sounds in order to be used inside the program.

ListFiles will help create an xml file for you to add into your [hydrogen beats](http://www.hydrogen-music.org/hcms/) sound directory  

Run ListFile with the following command:

    java ListFiles > output.xml

This will create a file ready to be copied into the drumkit.xml for your set of sounds
Add your output to the drumkit.xml and load up hydrongen and your sounds should be there
